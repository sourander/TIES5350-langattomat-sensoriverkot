    ABSTRACT = {In the last few years, there has been a huge interest in the Internet of Things (hereinafter IoT) field. Among the large number of IoT technologies, the low-power wide-area network (hereinafter LPWAN) has emerged providing low power, low data-rate communication over long distances, enabling battery-operated devices to operate for long time periods. This paper introduces an application of long-range (hereinafter LoRa) technology, one of the most popular LPWANs, to volcanic surveillance. The first low-power and low-cost wireless network based on LoRa to monitor the soil temperature in thermal anomaly zones in volcanic areas has been developed. A total of eight thermometers (end devices) have been deployed on a Teide volcano in Tenerife (Canary Islands). In addition, a repeater device was developed to extend the network range when the gateway did not have a line of sight connection with the thermometers. Combining LoRa communication capabilities with microchip microcontrollers (end devices and repeater) and a Raspberry Pi board (gateway), three main milestones have been achieved: (i) extreme low-power consumption, (ii) real-time and proper temperature acquisition, and (iii) a reliable network operation. The first results are shown. These results provide enough quality for a proper volcanic surveillance.},

    abstract = {In recent years, communication technology has improved exponentially, partly owing to the locations and nature of the deployment of sensor nodes. Wireless sensor networks (WSNs) comprise these sensor nodes and can provide real-time physical and environmental measurements. The sensor nodes have limited power, which reduces their lifespan, especially when placed in human-inaccessible locations. This paper reviews energy-efficient protocols for environmental monitoring applications and energy harvesting-wireless sensor networks. The dynamic deployment and communication challenges associated with environmental monitoring applications (EMAs) make this paper take into account the WSN protocol stack, focusing on the physical layer, network layer (routing), and medium access control (MAC). The paper will delve deeper into the security challenges of deploying sensor nodes for environmental monitoring applications (EMAs). The paper further describes scientific approaches that churn out innovative and engineering applications that must be followed to improve environmental monitoring applications.},

    ABSTRACT = {Wireless Sensor Networks are considered to be among the most rapidly evolving technological domains thanks to the numerous benefits that their usage provides. As a result, from their first appearance until the present day, Wireless Sensor Networks have had a continuously growing range of applications. The purpose of this article is to provide an up-to-date presentation of both traditional and most recent applications of Wireless Sensor Networks and hopefully not only enable the comprehension of this scientific area but also facilitate the perception of novel applications. In order to achieve this goal, the main categories of applications of Wireless Sensor Networks are identified, and characteristic examples of them are studied. Their particular characteristics are explained, while their pros and cons are denoted. Next, a discussion on certain considerations that are related with each one of these specific categories takes place. Finally, concluding remarks are drawn.},
